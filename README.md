# Phonaify
A Chrome extension that helps you perfect your pronunciation and understanding of English!

Uses local Gemini Nano's Prompt API in Chrome to layout standard definitions and phonetics, extract user pronunciations, and give feedback based off of phonetics of user pronunciations.

⚠️NOTE⚠️: Since Gemini Nano's Prompt API is only experimental in Chrome, go to `chrome://flags` and enable Prompt API in order to use Phonaify. (May also need page refresh after Chrome re-launch)

## Implementation details
- Structured output to retrieve definition, synonyms, parts of speech, phonetics, and example sentences of a word
- Structured output for audio and text prompt to Gemini Nano to retrieve user's pronunciations
- LCS (longest common sequence) to compare/diff phonetics between standard vs. user pronunciations

## Todos in future
- Have long memory/context of user pronunciations to track user's pronunciation over time
- Cold start is really slow right now - ~4 seconds. maybe use caching/initialzing the local model in background
- LCS is simple but has drawbacks, i.e. it's character level comparison. We should explore other comparisons for phonetics

## Developing locally

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`, enable "Developer mode", and load the unpacked extension from the `dist` directory.

4. Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```
